# FrontEnd Development course on Udacity â€” Project 2 - Landing page (JavaScript)

This project demonstrates an understanding of the basics of pure JavaScript in the Web API domain.

## Employed APIs

- Mutation Observer API. Used to achieve a dynamic generation of navigation based on changing contents of the page.
- Intersection Observer API. Used to style page elements in response to elements coming into the viewport.

## Delineating Udacity template code from mine

The only part I wrote in full is the app.js file. Most of the other code is provided by Udacity:

- In the CSS folder, I only added a differentiation of active section in the navigation bar by adding a background color. For a demonstration of understanding CSS basics, check out [the first project](https://github.com/mimkorn/Udacity-FrontEnd-PersonalBlog-project).
- index.html was only modified to append the JavaScript and the fourth static section.

## Further notes

I intentionally didn't leave many comments in the code first. I try to adhere to the principle of self-explanatory code. When one cannot achieve high-readability in code, a comment is the last resort to shed some light. However, the reviewer returned the project because of missing documentation, so I wrote it in full. I'll leave it up to you to decide if it was justified, considering code readability.
