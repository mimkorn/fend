# Landing Page Project

This project is to demonstrate learning in the area of pure JavaScript in the Web API domain. It employs Mutation Observer API and Intersection Observer API to enrich a sample static landing page with a degree of dynamicity.

- Styles were amended only to achieve smooth scrolling mentioned in the project's rubric.
- index.html was only modified to append the JavaScript.
- Most of the work of the project is in the app.js file.
- I intentionally didn't leave many comments in the code. I try to adhere to the principle of self-explanatory code. When one cannot achieve high-readability in code, a comment is the last resort to shed some light.
